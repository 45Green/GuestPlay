# GuestPlay [UNMAINTAINED]
```
When Roblox starts to remove guest mode, most of their community and developers has
been frustrating. Most "Play as a Guest" apps/exploits at that time has terrible UI 
and were very suspicious, GuestPlay had all the advantages of competitors and
developer support for free.

After a (relatively) long time, Roblox has fixed their auth system and the Guests
are officially dead, now GuestPlay has changed forever and this is not that
extension what developers imagined before.

Thank you for supporting us by using GuestPlay, but sometimes you just have to let
it go, keep *Powering Imagination* (TM).
